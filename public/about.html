<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there, I'm Lloyd!</p>

<p>I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I completed my boot camp courses on Udemy by taking the "Complete Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. I have tried other online bootcamps but with her I was able to learn it fairly easier. I have full confidence in all the software. Since I am coming in with no work experience, I hope my portfolio will be impressive enough to catch your eye.</p>

<p>My professional experience comes from the Biotech field. From starting from the bottom as a temporary worker as a manufacturing technician. Once i was hired, I climb my way up to a tech 3 and became the "go to" technician. From there I was promoted to a Quality Technician 3 in a new department.
  I went on to relocate and had to start over. Currently a production coordinator, thankfully my experience with SAP help me land the job. Now looking to further my career, I decided to get into the coding field. I have confidence in myself that I can do this, since 
  I have come from the bottom, I can succeed in coding as well with just some patience.  </p>
